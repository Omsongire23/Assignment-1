# Basic Python Concepts - Assignment 1

This repository contains solutions for **Assignment 1** from **Module 2: Basic Python Concepts**. It includes two Python scripts that demonstrate:

- Basic mathematical operations (Task 1)
- String manipulation to create a personalized greeting (Task 2)

## Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
### Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2. Performs the following operations:
   - Addition
   - Subtraction
   - Multiplication
   - Division
3. Displays the result of each operation.

### Example:
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 10

Addition: 15
Subtraction: -5
Multiplication: 50
Division: 0.5

## Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting
### Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:

1. Takes the user's first and last name as input.
2. Concatenates them into a full name.
3. Prints a personalized greeting message.

### Example:
Enter your first name: John
Enter your last name: Doe
